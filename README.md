# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for projects from **Harvard's CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. The course explores fundamental concepts in AI, including **search algorithms, optimization, machine learning, and neural networks**.

## üìå Course Overview
CS50 AI is an introduction to artificial intelligence, covering topics such as:
- **Search Algorithms** (e.g., BFS, DFS, A*)
- **Optimization** (e.g., Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- **Machine Learning** (e.g., Classification, Regression)
- **Neural Networks** (e.g., TensorFlow-based models)
- **Natural Language Processing** (e.g., sentiment analysis, Markov models)

## üìÅ Projects Included
| Project  | Description  |
|----------|-------------|
| **Degrees** | Implements a **graph search algorithm** (BFS) to find the shortest path between two actors in the **Kevin Bacon game**, using a dataset of movies and actors. |
